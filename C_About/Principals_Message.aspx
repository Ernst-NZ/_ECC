  NAU MAI, HAERE MAI KI TE KURA TUARUA O EDGECUMBE.<br /><br />
  WELCOME TO EDGECUMBE COLLEGE.</b><br /><br /></div>
<div>We are a rural bi-cultural school that has a history of outstanding success.&nbsp; Our focus is on teaching, learning and achievement and making EDGECUMBE COLLEGE&nbsp; the school of choice.<br /><br />
      At Edgecumbe College students are encouraged to develop a sense of responsibility for their own education and an appreciation of the importance of lifelong learning.&nbsp; I would also like students, staff and members of the community to view Edgecumbe College with a sense of belonging and with a sense of ownership so that it becomes our school, our uniform, our buildings and grounds and our whanau &ndash; our community secondary school.<br /><br />
      Our high quality, hard working staff has a positive view of students&rsquo; abilities to learn and to succeed.&nbsp; We operate with clear standards and expectations for both students and staff in an environment of support and encouragement.&nbsp; We believe students have ability in some areas and our aim is to provide encouragement by building on those strengths.<br /><br />
      We are very well resourced with extensive grounds, a solar heated pool, a gymnasium, a music suite, and approximately 200 computers &ndash; most in classrooms and available to students.<br /><br />
      We recognise our students as 21<sup>st</sup> century learners and our staff are constantly examining our practices and embracing change.&nbsp; The New Zealand Curriculum provides us with the opportunity to look at our programs of teaching and learning with the view to catering better for the 21<sup>st</sup> century learner. We are currently reviewing our curriculum so that this happens the way we, the Edgecumbe Community, want it to happen.<br /><br /><br />
Nāku noa nā<br /><br />
