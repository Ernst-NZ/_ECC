<p>The Shield is rimmed with gold, signifying worth or value.&nbsp; It could also signify the butter, or golden sunshine, of the Rangitaiki Plains.</p>
<p>The boar, second only to the lion for courage, is featured also in the Earl of Edgecumbe&rsquo;s coat of arms. The two golden boars&rsquo; heads grin wickedly in the red background &ndash; red, the colour of blood, or life.</p>
<p>The pointed chevron straddling the shield stands for Mt Edgecumbe (Putauaki) and the stylised trees, representing the timber wealth of our area, stand out against a white field signifying purity.</p>
<p>The green trees represent the lush grass growth on the Rangitaiki Plains.</p>

    <p class="myBold">MOTTO</p>
<p>The motto is a single word INTEGRITY.&nbsp; This word is rich in meaning and association &ndash; sincerity, purity, honesty, uprightness, completeness, soundness, worth and commitment &ndash; which encompasses our core values. It is a word implying quality in all things, a worthwhile ideal for all persons associated with Edgecumbe College.<br />
