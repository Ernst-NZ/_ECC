    <p class="myHeader">What is English about?</p>
    <!-- page content -->
    <p>English is the study,  use, and enjoyment of the English language and its literature,  communicated orally, visually, and in writing, for a range of purposes  and audiences and in a variety of text forms. Learning English  encompasses learning the language, learning through the language, and  learning about the language.</p>
    <p>Understanding, using, and creating  oral, written, and visual texts of increasing complexity is at the heart  of English teaching and learning. By engaging with text-based  activities, students become increasingly skilled and sophisticated  speakers and listeners, writers and readers, presenters and viewers.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="myHeader">Why study English?</p>
    <p>Literacy  in English gives students access to the understanding, knowledge, and  skills they need to participate fully in the social, cultural,  political, and economic life of New Zealand and the wider world. To be  successful participants, they need to be effective oral, written, and  visual communicators who are able to think critically and in depth.</p>
    <p>By  understanding how language works, students are equipped to make  appropriate language choices and apply them in a range of contexts.  Students learn to reconstruct and critically interrogate texts in order  to understand the power of language to enrich and shape their own and  others&rsquo; lives.</p>
    <p>Students appreciate and enjoy texts in all their  forms. The study of New Zealand and world literature contributes to  students&rsquo; developing sense of identity, their awareness of New Zealand&rsquo;s  bi-cultural heritage, and their understanding of the world.</p>
    <p>Success  in English is fundamental to success across the curriculum. All  learning areas (with the possible exception of languages) require  students to receive, process, and present ideas or information using the  English language as a medium. English can be studied both as a heritage  language and as an additional language.</p>
    <p>English presents students with opportunities to engage with and develop the key competencies in diverse contexts.</p>
