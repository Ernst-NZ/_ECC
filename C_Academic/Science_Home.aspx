    <!-- page content -->
    <p>Science is a way of  investigating, understanding, and explaining our natural, physical world  and the wider universe. It involves generating and testing ideas,  gathering evidence &ndash; including by making observations, carrying out  investigations and modeling, and communicating and debating with others  &ndash; in order to develop scientific knowledge, understanding, and  explanations. Scientific progress comes from logical, systematic work  and from creative insight, built on a foundation of respect for  evidence. Different cultures and periods of history have contributed to  the development of science.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="myHeader">Why study science?</p>
    <p>Science  is able to inform problem solving and decision making in many areas of  life. Many of the major challenges and opportunities that confront our  world need to be approached from a scientific perspective, taking into  account social and ethical considerations.</p>
    <p>By studying science, students:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 25px">
      <li>develop an understanding of the world, built on current scientific theories</li>
      <li>learn that science involves particular processes and ways of  developing and organising knowledge and that these continue to evolve</li>
      <li>use their current scientific knowledge and skills for problem solving and developing further knowledge</li>
      <li>use scientific knowledge and skills to make informed decisions about  the communication, application, and implications of science as these  relate to their own lives and cultures and to the sustainability of the  environment.</li>
    </ul>
