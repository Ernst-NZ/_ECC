    <p class="myHeader">What is health and physical education about?</p>
    <!-- page content -->
    <p>In  health and physical education, the focus is on the well-being of the  students themselves, of other people, and of society through learning in  health-related and movement contexts.</p>
    <p>Four underlying and interdependent concepts are at the heart of this learning area:</p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 25px">
      <li><a href="http://nzcurriculum.tki.org.nz/Curriculum-documents/The-New-Zealand-Curriculum/Learning-areas/Health-and-physical-education#footnote-1"><strong>Hauora</strong></a> &ndash; a Māori philosophy of well-being that includes the dimensions taha  wairua, taha hinengaro, taha tinana, and taha whānau, each one  influencing and supporting the others.</li>
      <li><strong>Attitudes and values</strong> &ndash; a positive, responsible  attitude on the part of students to their own well-being; respect, care,  and concern for other people and the environment; and a sense of social  justice.</li>
      <li>The <strong>socio-ecological perspective</strong> &ndash; a way of viewing and understanding the interrelationships that exist between the individual, others, and society.</li>
      <li><strong>Health promotion</strong> &ndash; a process that helps to develop  and maintain supportive physical and emotional environments and that  involves students in personal and collective action.</li>

    </ul>

    <p class="myHeader">Why study in this learning area?</p>
    <p>Through  learning and by accepting challenges in health-related and movement  contexts, students reflect on the nature of well-being and how to  promote it. As they develop resilience and a sense of personal and  social responsibility, they are increasingly able to take responsibility  for themselves and contribute to the well-being of those around them,  of their communities, of their environments (including natural  environments), and of the wider society.</p>
    <p>This learning area makes a  significant contribution to the well-being of students beyond the  classroom, particularly when it is supported by school policies and  procedures and by the actions of all people in the school community.</p>
