    <p>Physics is currently offered at Level 2 and 3 and taught by Stacey Andrews BSc. Students at year 12 who have not met the prerequisites for study at Level 2 may enter into a Level 1 course.</p>
    <p><b>To study at Level 2</b> students must show aptitude in Level 1 Science and Maths by gaining at least 12 credits in Level 1 science (particularly recommended is Achievement in Standard 90191 The nature of Physics) and credits in Algebra and Graphing.</p>
    <p>In this course students must study Mechanics (a study of forces and motion) and Electricity. Further units in Experimental Technique, Waves and Optics, and Atomic and Nuclear physics are offered.</p>
    <p>A full course contains 21 credits and is recommended to have 6 hours of study a week. Four hours of this are provided at school and the remaining time is a homework expectation. With this in mind, a text book at a cost of $20 is essential to the course. Further stationary requirements are a refill pad and a graph pad and, of course, a scientific calculator.</p>
